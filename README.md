Task Management app

To utilize the todo list task management app, add items and submit them. You can check-off items to add them to your completed list, view active items in the active list, and view active and completed items under "all". Delete items by clicking the trashcan icon.

Technologies Used include CSS, Javascript, React and React-Router.

For improvement I would have the checkbox, text input, and delete event stack underneath each other, make the 'all', 'active', and 'completed' buttons change color on-click, and develop the contact form.
