Task Management app

To utilize the todo list task management app, add items and submit them. You can check-off items to add them to the "completed" list, view active items in the "active" list, and view active and completed items under "all". Delete items by clicking the trashcan icon.

Technologies used include CSS, Javascript, React and React-Router.

For improvement I would develop the contact form, create a scrolling list to append tasks to, and add login for later visitation.


User stories: 

As a new user, I would like to be able to see a sample todo list item, so I am immediately familiar with the app functionality.

As a focused user, I would like to be able to entirely delete todo list items, so that they are not in any category on the app.

As a user that wants to track their progress with the app, I would like the items I add to be categorizeable under "all", "active", or "completed", depending on whether I have checked it off.
